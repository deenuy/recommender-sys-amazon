# Recommender Systems for Amazon
This is a repository for Recommender systems that has different types of item recommendation and rating prediction approaches performed on Amazon dataset.

# Algorithms

Item Recommendation:

- BPRMF

- ItemKNN

- Item Attribute KNN

- UserKNN

- User Attribute KNN

- Group-based (Clustering-based algorithm)

- Paco Recommender (Co-Clustering-based algorithm)

- Most Popular

- Random

- Content Based

Rating Prediction:

- Matrix Factorization (with and without baseline)

- Non-negative Matrix Factorization

- SVD

- SVD++

- ItemKNN

- Item Attribute KNN

- UserKNN

- User Attribute KNN

- Item NSVD1 (with and without Batch)

- User NSVD1 (with and without Batch)

- Most Popular

- Random

- gSVD++

- Item-MSMF

- (E) CoRec

Clustering:

- PaCo: EntroPy Anomalies in Co-Clustering

- k-medoids

# Evaluation and Validation Metrics

- All-but-one Protocol

- Cross-fold-Validation

- Item Recommendation: Precision, Recall, NDCG and Map

- Rating Prediction: MAE and RMSE

- Statistical Analysis (T-test and Wilcoxon)

# Requirements

- Python
- scipy
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- GCP VM instance
- Amazon Datasets
