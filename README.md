# Recommender Systems for Amazon
This is a repository for Recommender systems that has different types of item recommendation and rating prediction approaches performed on Amazon dataset.

# Algorithms

Item Recommendation:

- BPRMF

- ItemKNN

- Item Attribute KNN

- UserKNN

- User Attribute KNN

- Group-based (Clustering-based algorithm)

- Paco Recommender (Co-Clustering-based algorithm)

- Most Popular

- Random

- Content Based

Rating Prediction:

- Matrix Factorization (with and without baseline)

- Non-negative Matrix Factorization

- SVD

- SVD++

- ItemKNN

- Item Attribute KNN

- UserKNN

- User Attribute KNN

- Item NSVD1 (with and without Batch)

- User NSVD1 (with and without Batch)

- Most Popular

- Random

- gSVD++

- Item-MSMF

- (E) CoRec

Clustering:

- PaCo: EntroPy Anomalies in Co-Clustering

- k-medoids

# Evaluation and Validation Metrics

- All-but-one Protocol

- Cross-fold-Validation

- Item Recommendation: Precision, Recall, NDCG and Map

- Rating Prediction: MAE and RMSE

- Statistical Analysis (T-test and Wilcoxon)

# Requirements

- Python
- scipy
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- GCP VM instance
- Amazon Datasets 

# Prerequisite Installations to run Notebook on GCP VM instance
Create a VM instance as shown in below article for integration of Google Colab and Google Cloud Platform. 
    - https://towardsdatascience.com/running-jupyter-notebook-in-google-cloud-platform-in-15-min-61e16da34d52

Create a firewall rule 

Update Google Cloud Platform  

    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get --assume-yes upgrade
    $ sudo apt-get --assume-yes install software-properties-common

Python Package Manager and Jupyter Notebook setup on GCP 

    $ sudo apt-get install python3-pip
    $ sudo apt-get install python-setuptools python-dev build-essential
    $ sudo pip install jupyter
    $ wget http://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-4.0.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
    $ bash Anaconda3-4.0.0-Linux-x86_64.sh (Continue Yes as default for all prompts)

Install a Python package containing Jupyter Extensions
    $ sudo apt-get install helpful_package (or)
    $ sudo pip install helpful_package
    $ jupyter serverextension enable --py helpful_package

Generate Jupyter notebook configuration file (jupyter_notebook_config.py):
    $ jupyter notebook --generate-config

Add below configuration in the Jupyter notebook config file:
    $ sudo vi ~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py

        # Configuration file for jupyter-notebook.
        c = get_config()
        c.NotebookApp.ip = '*'
        c.NotebookApp.open_browser = False
        c.NotebookApp.port = 8089 (Note that this is TCP port configured in GCP External IP and firewall)

Launching Jupyter Notebook
    $ jupyter-notebook --no-browser --port=8089 
    
    Once console starts successfully, go to browser and run as following. Note that external ip address is the ip address which we made static and port number is the one which we allowed firewall access to as per above article. 

    http://<External Static IP Address>:<Port Number>
